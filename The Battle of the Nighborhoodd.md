# Capstone Project Battle of the Neighborhoods (Week 4)

## Business Problem
Mexico is a developing country, where people come from Cenral America to start with something. When you go to a new country, you have no idea where to put your new restaurant or coffee shop. There are two main ways of doing this. One is walking for ages on the streets and looking with your own eyes the posible location where to start your empire, or using data.We will use data to make the decision on the place that is the most convenient for your new business.

With the data, we will see all the coffee shops in Mexico City with a Map. Once we have the map, we will make a conclusion for the best new location to open a coffe shop.

As Mexico is a developing country, there are many opportunities for opening new businesses. For the new coffee shop place, I am hoping that it is going to be a center spot. 

## Data
With the business problem well defined the next factors are crucial:
- Number of existing coffee shops in Mexico City
- Number of existing coffee shops in the neighborhood

#### Data sources where we will extract information
- To get the center of Mexico City I will use **Wikipedia** information
- Coffee shops in Mexico City from **Foursqueare API**
